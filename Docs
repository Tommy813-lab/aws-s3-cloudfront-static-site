# Static Website Architecture: S3 + CloudFront

## üß† Overview

This document explains how this project uses **Amazon S3** and **CloudFront** to host and deliver a static website at global scale using infrastructure-as-code (Terraform).

The setup:
- Stores HTML, CSS, JS in an S3 bucket
- Delivers it globally via CloudFront CDN
- Uses Origin Access Control (OAC) for secure, private S3 content
- Entirely automated with Terraform

## ‚öôÔ∏è Components

### 1. Amazon S3 (Static Web Hosting)

- Stores your static files (`index.html`, CSS, JS, images)
- Website mode enabled in the bucket (for routing)
- Public access **blocked** ‚Äì content served only via CloudFront

### 2. CloudFront (CDN)

- Global edge delivery
- Handles HTTPS and performance caching
- Uses **OAC** to securely fetch from private S3

### 3. Terraform

- Defines, deploys, and manages both services
- Tracks state for repeatable, version-controlled infra
