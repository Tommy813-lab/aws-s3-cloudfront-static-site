🌐 Static Website Architecture: S3 + CloudFront
Built & Documented by Charles — Aspiring Cloud Engineer
🧠 Overview
This project shows how I set up a secure, fast, and globally available static website using Amazon S3 and CloudFront.

The Setup:

Static files like HTML, CSS, JS live in an S3 bucket

CloudFront delivers the content worldwide for speed and reliability

Origin Access Control (OAC) keeps the S3 bucket private — only CloudFront can access it

This type of architecture is common for portfolios, product pages, landing pages, or lightweight websites that need high performance and solid security.

⚙️ How It Works
1. 🪣 Amazon S3 — Static File Storage
Hosts static files: index.html, CSS, JS, images

Static Website Hosting enabled for clean routing

Public Access BLOCKED — bucket isn’t exposed directly to the internet

Only CloudFront can fetch content from the bucket

2. 🌍 Amazon CloudFront — Global Content Delivery
Speeds up delivery using edge locations around the world

Handles HTTPS, providing secure connections for users

Uses Origin Access Control (OAC) so only CloudFront can access private S3 content

Supports custom domain names and SSL certificates for branded, secure websites

🔐 Security Highlights
✅ S3 bucket kept private — no direct public access
✅ Only CloudFront allowed to access the S3 bucket via OAC
✅ HTTPS enforced for secure traffic
✅ Bucket policies and CloudFront settings work together for extra protection
